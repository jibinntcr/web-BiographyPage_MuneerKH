      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Entrepreneur and Business Leader with Diverse Industry Experience</p>
      <p>As an entrepreneur and business leader with over seven years of experience, I bring a passion for innovation, strategic thinking, and operational excellence to every endeavor. Currently, I serve as the Managing Director of Neom Building Solutions, where I spearhead the company's growth and expansion into new markets. Additionally, I hold partnerships with Newtech Plywoods and Infinio Technology Solutions, leveraging my expertise to foster strategic alliances and enhance business outcomes.</p>
      <p>My entrepreneurial spirit extends to my teaching career, where I currently excel as an Assistant Professor in the MBA department at MES AIMAT. Prior to this, I gained valuable industry insights as a Business Development Officer at New-tech Ply & Boards and as a field assistant at Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL).</p>
      <p>Complementing my extensive professional experience is a strong academic background. I hold a Master of Commerce (M.COM) from Indira Gandhi Open University, a Postgraduate Diploma in International Business Operation (PGDIBO), and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the School of Management Studies (SMS) at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT). My academic achievements are further solidified by my success in the State Eligibility Test (SET), the National Eligibility Test (UGC NET), and the Post Graduate Diploma in International Business Operations (PGDIBO).</p>
